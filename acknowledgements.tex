\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank professor Arthur Sloan for his valuable feedback and
invaluable encouragement throughout this project: receiving constructive
directions when I was off track, and praise when I was on target made a huge
difference.

I would also like to thank my wonderful partner Kasia for keeping our young
family thriving, especially during the last sprint, when I needed maximum focus
to complete the project, and my marvelous two-year-old daughter Clara for being
part of the motivation that helped me to bring this experience to conclusion,
although she is too young to know this.

A kind thank you to Claudio, Marianna and Alberto, friends and colleagues that
were there to offer a shoulder to cry on, the times I felt I was getting
nowhere, when I was trying every possible combination of a configuration file,
and none would work, so much so that even the most skeptical person would
concede machines too can be irrationally spiteful sometimes.

I am equally grateful to my boss, Kevin, with whose blessing I was able to
learn and test at work (for work related tasks, I should clarify) some of the
technologies required for this project. Also, it is his voice I hear in my head
when wrestling with my non-native English, telling me: ``clarify,
simplify, summarize''.

Finally, I would like to thank those DIT lecturers that, between 2012 and 2016,
really inspired me to take their teaching as a starting platform, an appetizer,
and keep exploring on my own.
